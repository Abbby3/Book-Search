### Book Search

A react based web application for searching books using the Google Books API.

# Features

This web application allows users to search for books by title, author, or publisher, or a combination of the three, using the Google Books API.
Users can input search terms in the respective fields to filter searches by title, author and publisher.
On searching, the application fetches data from the Google Books API, and displays basic information on the books, such as a thumbnail, or simply title and author if a thumbnail is unavailable.
The users can then click on a book to view more information, including a link to purchase the book.
The application also notifies users of errors based on either the search terms or the API.
It also includes an updated design convention and colour scheme to that of older projects of mine.

Future iterations of this should ideally include:

- functionality to favourite or save books.
- removing text from field inputs when the option is deselected.
- updated date format
- improved optimisation, including reusable components, such as forms.

# Tools

This web app uses html, scss and javascript.
